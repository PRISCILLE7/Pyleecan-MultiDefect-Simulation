## Abstract
This master’s thesis focuses on the generation and simulation of multiple electrical machine faults using the **Pyleecan** open-source simulation framework.  
The main objective is to build a **structured and labeled dataset** of physical signals (electromagnetic torque, flux density, currents, etc.) under various fault conditions, intended for **AI-assisted fault diagnosis**.

The study investigates several types of defects, including geometric, magnetic, and winding-related faults, and analyzes their impact on machine behavior.  
The resulting dataset is designed to support machine learning and deep learning models for intelligent condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of electric machines.
